# ReviewApp
A team programming project done in 1st Year at TCD. A reviews app (such as yelp) done in processing.

This application can be ran using processing:

```

This project uses a MySql database hosted on AWS which I was personally in charge of setting up. I also was in charge of transitioning our application from using a small data set in CSV format to using this MySl databse which enabled us to use a much larger data set of about 7GB. This dataset can be found on yelps website.

```

On top of this I also was in charge of creating systems to transform the data into a displayable format, which included querying the database to get information about a review, formating it with information about the author and the author as well as the review itself.

I also made sure that everything the team produced worked together amongst other smaller tasks.
